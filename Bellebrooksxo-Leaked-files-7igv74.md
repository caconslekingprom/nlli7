Her songs often explore themes of love, relationships, and self-discovery, with a focus on storytelling and emotional authenticity. Bellebrooksxo's influences range from classic rock and pop to electronic and indie music, and she has cited artists such as Radiohead, Björk, and St. Vincent as key inspirations.
